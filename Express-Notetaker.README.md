## Description
I was tasked with completing the backed functions for a browser Notetaker that includes a homepage with buttons. There is a get started button that will take you to the page where you can enter a note title and corresponding text. The backend functions included linking the public index.html and notes.html within a server.js and getting/posting/deleting notes from a json file by utlizing Express.js, path and a random number generator (UUID).

## Installation
Programs needed are express.js, path, util, and uuid.

## Usage
This project is used to take notes that will be saved onto the page, delete notes that have been completed or finished.

## Summary
I definitely learned that every method needs a response, as well as, a request. It was challenging mastering the syntax that goes into express and utlizing one line functions/arrow functions.
